# Getting all but the first element from Ruby array

When getting all but the first element from an array in Ruby, we have a few
options.

Given the following list:
----------------------
list = [1,2,3,4]
----------------------

>> class Array
>>   def clip n=1
>>     take size - n
>>   end
>> end
=> nil
>> a
=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
>> a.clip
=> [1, 2, 3]
>> a = a + a
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>> a.clip 2
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2]
